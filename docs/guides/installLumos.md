title: Install Lumos Packages
---
This guide introduces how to add necessary  [Lumos Components (Packages)](../introduction/lumoscomponents) to a Node.js project as dependencies. <!--For the projects that have already listed Lumos packages as dependencies, just run `yarn install` in the projects directly to install the packages.--> 

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites apply for installing Lumos packages as dependencies for a project:

- The development environment is set up. 

  For more information, see [Set Up the Development Environment](../preparation/setupsystem).

## Environment

The following examples are verified on Ubuntu 20.04.2. Steps on the other platforms can be adjusted accordingly.

## Install Lumos

### Step 1. Navigate into the directory of the project.

Navigate into the directory of the project, for example, <var>mydapp</var>.

```
$ cd mydapp
```

### Step 2. If this is a new project, initialize the project by using the `yarn init` command.

This command prompts questions about the name and version of the project and the name of the initial entry point file (by default this is **index.js**). Just accept the defaults by hitting enter or type answers for each of the questions.

```
$ yarn init
```

```shell
yarn init v1.22.5
question name (mydapp):
question version (1.0.0):
question description:
question entry point (index.js):
question repository url:
question author:
question license (MIT):
question private:
success Saved package.json
Done in 44.54s.
```

### Step 3. Install Lumos packages as dependencies for the project.

A Lumos package can be installed by using the `yarn add @ckb-lumos/<package name> ` command according to the application requirements.

The following example installs the Lumos RocksDB backed indexer, the common-scripts, the config-manager packages and their dependencies for the project.

```shell
$ yarn add @ckb-lumos/indexer@0.16.0 @ckb-lumos/common-scripts@0.16.0 @ckb-lumos/config-manager@0.16.0
```

<p>

```shell
yarn add v1.22.5

## Troubleshooting

### gyp Error About Missing Dependencies for node-gyp

If any gyp error about missing dependencies for node-gyp is encountered, check the details of [Install Dependencies for node-gyp](../preparation/setupsystem#install-dependencies-for-node-gyp) or the instructions on [node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) to fix the error.

### Error While Rebuilding the xxhash Package

node-gyp rebuilds the xxhash package during the `yarn add` installation process. Incompatible Node.js may cause the rebuilding failure. Reinstall a lower version of Node.js, for example, Node.js 12, and then install Lumos packages.
