A CKB node can be set up to connect and interact with one of the following CKB networks:

- **Mainnet (Lina)**: The Mainnet is the main CKB public network. The real-time information of the Lina Mainnet can be checked on the [CKB Explorer](https://explorer.nervos.org/) page.

- **Testnet (Aggron4)**: The Testnet is used to test applications integration and smart contracts in real environment with actual data. 

  For the first time to start running a node on the Testnet, syncing data requires upwards of one hour for the current number of blocks (**1,300,000+**). The real-time block number on the Testnet can be checked on the [CKB Explorer](https://explorer.nervos.org/aggron) page.

  To get CKB capacity on the Testnet, go to [https://faucet.nervos.org](https://faucet.nervos.org/) and paste the Testnet address of the address in the address input box, then click the **Claim** button. For more information, see [Create an Account](../preparation/createaccount).

- **DEV Chain**:  The DEV chain is a local blockchain that provides an efficient and useful development mode for building and testing applications. <!--This is the recommended network for starters and DApp developers.--> 

  To get CKB capacity for an account on the DEV chain, the account can be specified as the miner in the chain configurations. For more information, see [Create an Account](../preparation/createaccount).
