The intention of this documentation is to give you an understanding of Lumos and how Lumos is applied when developing applications on CKB. <!--This documentation guide offers the informational content to help you get started developing CKB DApps on the Lumos framework.-->

The Lumos documentation includes the following sections:

1. The **Introduction** sections introduce the architecture, components, general scenarios, and prerequisites.
2. The **Getting Started** sections include the guides to prepare the development environment, install a CKB node, create accounts, and walk through a [Hello Lumos](../preparation/hellolumos) example, a simple hello world project built using the Lumos framework.
3. The **Guides** sections have more details about the basic concepts, workflows, and examples about the usage of Lumos.
4. The **Final Example** introduces how Lumos helps with a contract integration on CKB.
