The basic steps for developing a CKB DApp are as follows:

1. Learn the prerequisite skills.
2. Set up the development environment.
3. [Install a CKB Node](../preparation/installckb). 
4. [Install Lumos packages for a Node project](../preparation/installlumos).
5. Create an account.
6. [Set up the config manager](../tutorials/config).
7. [Set up the database](../tutorials/database).
8. Program CKB tasks. The DApps built with Lumos mainly deal with user queries and transaction requests, such as transferring capacity, deposits, withdrawals, and other operations of user assets.
