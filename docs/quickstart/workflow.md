The basic steps for developing a CKB DApp are as follows:

1. Prepare the prerequisite skills and development stacks listed in [Prerequisites](../quickstart/prerequisites).
2. [Install and configure a CKB DEV blockchain](../tutorials/installckb). 
4. [Install Lumos packages for a Node project](../tutorials/installlumos).
5. [Set up the config manager](../tutorials/config).
6. (Optional) [Set up the SQL database](../tutorials/database).
7. Start the Indexer.
8. Create an account for CKB transactions.
9. Program CKB tasks. The DApps built with Lumos mainly deal with user queries and transaction requests, such as transferring capacity, deposits, withdrawals, and other operations of user assets.
