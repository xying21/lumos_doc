title: Developing CKB DApps with Lumos
---
## Workflow

The basic steps for developing a CKB DApp are as follows:

1. Prepare the prerequisite skills and development stacks listed in [Prerequisites](../quickstart/prerequisites).
2. Install and configure Nervos CKB. 
3. Create a Node project.
4. [Set up the config manager](../tutorials/config).
5. [Set up the database](../tutorials/database).
6. Program CKB tasks. The DApps built with Lumos mainly deal with user queries and transaction requests, such as transferring capacity, deposits, withdrawals, and other operations of user assets.
